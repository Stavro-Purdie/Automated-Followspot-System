# Raspberry Pi WebRTC Camera Project

This project enables real-time video streaming from a Raspberry Pi equipped with a Pi Camera 3 NOIR. It utilizes WebRTC for low-latency communication and allows remote focus control. Additionally, it processes infrared (IR) signals to create a HOT/COLD view, where hot areas are displayed in white and cold areas in black.
